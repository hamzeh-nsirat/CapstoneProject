# Managing a Remote Repository as a Collaborator (Pushing to Development Branch)

<div>
  As a collaborator in this repository, you'll push changes to the <strong>development</strong> branch and create a pull request (PR) for the <strong>main</strong> branch. Below are the steps to follow:
</div>

<h2>1. Cloning the Repository</h2>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Obtain the repository URL from your friend’s GitHub.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal and run the following command:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git clone https://github.com/hamzehNsirat/Localized</code>
    </pre>
  </ul>
  This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.
</div>

<h2>2. Create a New Branch from Development</h2>

<div>
  It is recommended to create a new branch from the <strong>development</strong> branch to make changes. To do this:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate into the project directory:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>cd repository-name</code>
    </pre>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Switch to the <strong>development</strong> branch:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git checkout development</code>
    </pre>
  </ul>
  Now, you're working in the <code>development</code> branch.
</div>

<h2>3. Make Changes and Commit</h2>

<div>
  After making your changes, follow these steps to commit:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add your changes:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git add .</code>
    </pre>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Commit the changes with a descriptive message:</li>
    <strong>PLEASE AS I SAID BEFORE THE COMMIT MESSAGE IS SO IMPORTANT PLEASE PROVIDE WHAT YOU COMMITED</strong>
    <strong>I REPEATTTT AS ABOVEEEE</strong>
    <pre>
      <code>git commit -m "Describe your changes here"</code>
    </pre>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>4. Push Changes to the Development Branch</h2>

<div>
  Push your feature branch to the <strong>development</strong> branch in the remote repository:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Push the branch:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git push origin new-feature-branch</code>
    </pre>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>5. Open a Pull Request for Main Branch</h2>

<div>
  Once your feature branch is pushed to GitHub, you need to create a pull request to merge your changes into the <strong>main</strong> branch:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the repository on GitHub.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a pull request from <strong>development</strong> to <strong>main</strong>. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button for your branch.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add a title and description for the pull request, and submit it.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>6. Sync Changes from the Main Branch</h2>

<div>
  It’s important to stay updated with changes made in the <strong>main</strong> branch. Follow these steps to sync your local repository:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Switch to the <strong>main</strong> branch:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git checkout main</code>
    </pre>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Fetch the latest changes from the remote:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git fetch origin</code>
    </pre>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pull the latest changes into your local branch:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git pull origin main</code>
    </pre>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Why Use git fetch Before git pull?</h2>
Review Changes:<br>By using git fetch, you can review the incoming changes before merging them into your branch. This helps in understanding what updates have been made and if they might cause conflicts.
Avoid Conflicts: Fetching first allows you to ensure that your local repository is aware of any changes made in the remote repository, which can help avoid merge conflicts when you do pull.

<h2>For the Reviewers</h2>
<h2>7. Merge Main Branch into Your Feature Branch</h2>

<div>
  Before completing your pull request, merge the latest changes from the <strong>main</strong> branch into your feature branch:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Switch to your feature branch:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git checkout new-feature-branch</code>
    </pre>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Merge the main branch into your branch:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git merge main</code>
    </pre>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>8. Handling Merge Conflicts</h2>

<div>
  If you encounter merge conflicts, resolve them manually:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the conflicting files and fix the conflicts.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once resolved, add the files to the staging area:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git add .</code>
    </pre>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Commit the resolution:</li>
    <pre>
      <code>git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"</code>
    </pre>
  </ul>
</div>

    <li>Always sync your local repository with the main branch before starting new work.</li>
    <li>Use clear and descriptive commit messages and branch names for better collaboration.</li>
  </ul>
